So, if you know of a package or have authored one yourself, please head over to <a href="https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-package-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-package-repository</a> and either add the package via pull request or open an issue so I can add it.</p><p>If you like the project, please consider leaving a star on the <a href="https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-package-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub project</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/keneanung" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsoring me</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="v011-infrastructure-fix">v0.1.1 Infrastructure fix<a href="#v011-infrastructure-fix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to v0.1.1 Infrastructure fix" title="Direct link to v0.1.1 Infrastructure fix">​</a></h2><p>This version bump was only for infrastructure fixes.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm happy to announce that the project reached a huge milestone. It now handles dependencies of packages that are <a href="https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-package-repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listed in package repository</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="handling-dependencies">Handling dependencies<a href="#handling-dependencies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Handling dependencies" title="Direct link to Handling dependencies">​</a></h2><p>Whenever the package manager installs a package, it checks, whether it has other packages that are required for it to function correctly. These packages are first searched in the local package list. If they are installed, the package manager proceeds to install the original package as normal. If a dependency is not installed, the package manager will first install the dependency, before proceeding with the actual requested package installation.</p><p>The package manager will also make sure, that dependencies are listed in the correct order. This makes sure that the initialization of a package is only attempted when all dependencies are already initialized. No more documenting "and make sure package A is above package B". This happens both after the installation and update of a package.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ui-improvements">UI improvements<a href="#ui-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to UI improvements" title="Direct link to UI improvements">​</a></h2><p>The UI also got some improvements. You can now show package details within the window, including version, description, dependencies and a link to the website.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="package detail view" src="/nexus-package-manager/assets/images/detail_page-78b4a6740a57a19127a3465599fa1e12.png" width="386" height="484" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The UI main page got some layout imprvements by using icons instead of text for buttons, which makes the page much cleaner.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="package list view" src="/nexus-package-manager/assets/images/package_listing-27e49b83cfa747c79cde724cbe7f48a4.png" width="379" height="481" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="closing-words">Closing words<a href="#closing-words" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Closing words" title="Direct link to Closing words">​</a></h2><p>If these features got you interested, please feel free to either <a href="https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-package-repository/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=new+package&amp;template=new_package.yml&amp;title=%5BPackage%5D%3A+" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open an issue about including your package</a> in the package listing or contact me on the Achaea or Nexus discrod if you need more information.
